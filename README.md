## Classification-using-Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks
This repository consists of a jupyter Notebook for implementation of  KAN's for classification task. AIDS Disease classification data has been used. 

# Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks:
These are state of the art machine learning architecture where the activation functions are not fixed. Instead the activation functions too are learnable using b-splines.
As per the implementation it can be seen that the model using KAN architecture performs better with the lesser number of parameters as compared to ANN. 
But they also face common problems of overfitting and comparatively slower training. 

The notebook consists of implementation of KAN using the pykan library
